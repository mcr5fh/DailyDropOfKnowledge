NOTE: 

Serverless will give you a Creds not found error if you don't have a `[default]` IAM user with 
CloudFormation, S3, and probably more (everything but IAM) permissions set up in your `~/.aws/credentials` file

```
➜  daily-drop-server git:(master) ✗ serverless deploy
Serverless: DOTENV: Loading environment variables from .env:
Serverless: 	 - MONGO_URI

  Serverless Error ---------------------------------------

  AWS provider credentials not found. Learn how to set up AWS provider credentials in our docs here: <http://slss.io/aws-creds-setup>.
