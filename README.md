# Welcome to Readables

What is this all about?

The aim of Readbles is to create a user friendly way to facilitate spaced learning for whatever your reading, listening, or watching. The idea is that if you are able to answer a set of questions over an extended, increasing period of time, that you will effectively remember that knowledge forever. 

By essentially making your own flash cards, you are applying the Feynman technique
